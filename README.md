# Test Summary Report

## Feature Overview
The feature under test involves securing stored procedures in Snowflake from SQL attacks. The data flow begins from Informatica, moves to AWS S3, and is ingested into Snowflake using Airflow DAGs. The main schemas in Snowflake are raw, staging, and confirmed, containing tables such as accounts, party, party account bridge, risk rating, and cash flow fact. Post loading into the confirmed schema, an Airflow DAG triggers a process called "scenario" which utilizes the EMR cluster for processing, followed by additional operations in Snowflake.

## Test Objectives
- Validate the security of stored procedures in Snowflake against SQL injection and other SQL-based attacks.
- Ensure the integrity and accuracy of data as it flows through the entire pipeline from Informatica to the confirmed schema in Snowflake.
- Verify the proper execution and data processing of the Airflow DAGs and the EMR cluster.

## Test Scope
- Stored Procedures in Snowflake: accounts, party, party account bridge, risk rating, and cash flow fact tables in raw, staging, and confirmed schemas.
- Data flow validation: from Informatica to AWS S3, ingestion into Snowflake, and processing via Airflow DAGs and EMR clusters.

## Test Approach
### Security Testing
- Perform SQL injection tests on the stored procedures to ensure they are secure against malicious inputs.
- Validate the implementation of parameterized queries and input validation within the stored procedures.

### Functional Testing
- Verify the data flow from Informatica to AWS S3 and its subsequent ingestion into Snowflake.
- Ensure that the data in the raw, staging, and confirmed schemas are consistent and accurately reflect the source data.
- Test the execution of Airflow DAGs for data ingestion and processing in Snowflake.
- Validate the processing of the "scenario" using the EMR cluster and subsequent operations in Snowflake.

### Data Validation
- Compare data in raw, staging, and confirmed schemas to ensure data integrity and accuracy at each stage.
- Check specific tables (accounts, party, party account bridge, risk rating, cash flow fact) for correct data transformation and loading.

## Test Results
### Security Testing
- All stored procedures were tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- No vulnerabilities were detected; all procedures are secure.

### Functional Testing
- Data flow from Informatica to AWS S3 was successfully validated.
- Airflow DAGs were executed without errors, and data was ingested into Snowflake correctly.
- Data processing using the EMR cluster and subsequent Snowflake operations were verified.

### Data Validation
- Data integrity was maintained across raw, staging, and confirmed schemas.
- Specific tables (accounts, party, party account bridge, risk rating, cash flow fact) were correctly loaded and transformed.

## Defects
No defects were found during the testing phase.

## Conclusion
The feature has been successfully tested and is secure against SQL attacks. The data flow and processing are working as expected, with no discrepancies found in the data validation process. All test objectives have been met.
